# Earliest Use of the Term "Bug"

Did you know that Edison invented the use of the term "bug" to refer to a technical problem? The earliest documented use for the term as a technical glitch is found in the Oxford English Dictionary, which quotes a letter to the editor in the 15 September 1875 issue of the journal *Operator*, "The biggest ‘bug’ yet has been discovered in the U.S. Hotel Electric Annunciator." However, the sentence begins, "'Bugs' on the 'quad' are all very well in their way, but..." What the OED did not understand was that this use of bug was conceived by Edison in connection with his quadruplex telegraph.

Edison invented the quadruplex telegraph, which sent four messages, two in each direction, over a single wire, in 1874. By September 1875, the quadruplex was being used extensively by Western Union. A key feature of the quadruplex was what Edison called a "bug trap."
